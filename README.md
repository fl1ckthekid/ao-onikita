- Cipher puzzle

This cipher represents an *abacus*, which is a traditional counting tool.
Each column under the letters "PASS" represents a digit 0-9. 

Place the abacus in the frame where you find the map (or just use your imagination below).
Each dot on top in each column that touches the line adds 5 to the column value,
and each group of consecutive dots on the bottom that touches the line adds 1 to the value.
